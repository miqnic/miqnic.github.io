                        <p>
                            The dataset that I have chosen is the AddHealth dataset. It had a lot of variables which I am interested in knowing more about but for now, I chose to look at the correlation of students’ perceptions of other people’s feelings toward them and their academic performance. There are multiple studies on parental styles and self-esteem as a factor on their school achievements. I am curious to know if these perceptions of others’ feelings toward a student could be a factor on their academic success. 
                            <br><br>
                            I have searched for article related to the perceptions of others and academic performance. Upon researching, the closest resource I have found on it is titled <em><strong>Children’s Perceptions of their Teachers’ Feelings Toward them Related to Self-Perception, School Achievement and Behavior</strong></em> written by Helen Davidson and Gerhard Lang which was published on 1960! The next thing I searched for was academic standings and its relation with family (e.g. parental styles), teachers (e.g. teaching styles), and friends (e.g. positive/negative influence). Another study I found was titled <em><strong>Dropping out of high school: The role of parent and teacher self-determination support, reciprocal friendships and academic motivation</strong></em> written by Nathalie Ricard and Luc Pelletier which talked about these three (3) factors. 
                            <br><br>
                            With these in mind, the students’ perceptions of other people’s feelings toward them and their academic performance can be a factor in their academic performance mainly because they are always around these people. The less support they feel from other people, the more discouraged they will be and will perform worse than the respondents who are feeling the support people have for them. 
                            <br><br>
                            The dataset is divided into sections according to the code book given. I have chosen parts of <strong>Section 5</strong> which talks about the <em>academics and education of the respondent</em> and <strong>Section 35</strong> which talks about their <em>perception of others’ support on them</em>. I have compiled the variables that will be used. For the variables found in Section 5, I have only used the variables for the grade of the respondents in their Language, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science classes. I will be using all the variables in Section 35 as this revolve around the different groups of people the respondents socialize with almost everyday in their school life. 
                            <br><br>
                            Upon deciding on the variables that I am going to use, I have removed the other columns from the original code book so the data could be only focused on the topic I am pursuing.

                            </div>
                            <br>
                            I have also included a sample of correlating their academic standings and how much they would want to leave home below. The data in here shows that most of the people who had higher grades tend to not want to run away. This shows that support from the family is important in helping their children perform well.
