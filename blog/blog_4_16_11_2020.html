                            <h2>Creating Graphs for my Data</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            My research is all about the effect of a person’s self-perception to how other people’s care for them and their grades in various subjects. This makes the self-perception our <strong>independent or explanatory variable</strong> while the subject grades will be the <strong>dependent or response variable<strong>. Below are the graphs and code for the following:
                            <br>

                            <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="files/blog_4/SUPPORTSUM_graph_code.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                            </div>
                            
                            <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-7"><span class="image fit"><img src="files/blog_4/SUPPORTSUM_graph.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                            </div>

                            <br>
                            This is the univariate graph of the <strong>SUPPORTSUM</strong> variable. The graph is unimodal with its highest peak at the last category. The first two categories only have a few results when compared to the last two. The graph is skewed to the left as there are higher frequencies in higher categories. 
                            <br><br>

                            <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="files/blog_4/GRADEAVE_graph_code.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                            </div><br>
                            
                            <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-7"><span class="image fit"><img src="files/blog_4/GRADEAVE_graph.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                            </div>

                            <br>
                            The one above is the univariate graph of the <strong>GRADEAVE</strong> variable. The graph is unimodal with its highest peak at the last category. Unlike the first graph, all categories have values that are somehow spread out of all of them. The graph is also skewed to the left as there are higher frequencies in higher categories. 
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            Both of these are categorical ones so following the flowchart that was given, I have to collapse the response variable into two categories only. Since I have only four valid values to consider in the grades, I would collapse them into grades that have 50% and above averages and those that did not.
                            <br><br>

                            <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="files/blog_4/GRADEAVE_collapse_code.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                            </div>

                            <br>
                            I then mapped these categories into words that would be readable to the end user. The code is found below:
                            <br><br>

                            <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="files/blog_4/SUPPORTSUM_mapping_code.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                            </div>

                            <br>
                            With these in mind, the output graph of these two variables will result into a category to category bar graph with self-perception categories in the X-axis and the grades in the Y-axis.

							<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="files/blog_4/SUPPORTSUM_GRADEAVE_graph_code.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                            </div><br>
                            
                            <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="files/blog_4/SUPPORTSUM_GRADEAVE_graph.png" alt="" /></span></div>
							</div>

							<br>
                            The graph shows that the respondents who felt like people supported them in a very little amount has garnered the highest grade average followed by those who somewhat felt supported. Those who are supported quite a bit were next in line while those who are not at all supported showed the lowest grade average out of all the support categories.
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            This then concludes my assignments for the Data Management and Visualization Course by the Wesleyan University. I have learned a lot from this course and I hope to learn more in the following courses in the Data Analysis and Interpretation specialization. Special thanks as well to DOST Caraga who has offered a Coursera grant to tens of thousands of Filipinos. Thank you to the reviewers as well who has peer-graded my assignments and left helpful remarks.
