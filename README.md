# My portfolio site :sparkles:

###### :warning: This site is still in progress but I do add projects as I go along.

I decided to create a portfolio site so I could compile all of my projects into one site where people could see it easier rather than just listing them all down in a resume or in LinkedIn. Since I just want to put this out there, I used an HTML template called [Strata](https://html5up.net/strata) to get me started. 

### What more could I do to it?
:computer: **Add a live demo for all of my projects**  
This is my top priority right now. I am finding a way for my projects to be deployed so people could give them a whirl.

:card_index_dividers: **Add more sections**  
Maybe I could add more sections like skills, education, and the like? I'm looking into that.

:paintbrush: **Redesign the site**  
I would like to be able to create my own portfolio site from scratch but I still have to study up on my front-end skills.

:notebook: **Add a blog section**  
I am on the fence about this since I only have blog posts for one of the specializations that I am currently taking but, hey, maybe I'd write posts someday.
